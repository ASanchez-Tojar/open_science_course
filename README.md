## Repository contents

Folders

`code`: contains all R scripts

`data`: contains all data

`renv`: contains information created by the R package [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) with the aim of creating a reproducible environment for this R project (note: still trying to figure out exactly how to use it!) 

## How to run this repository

Open the file "course-project.Rproj" to open the R project, then run the first script ("001_first_script.R"), which creates a simulated dataset that can then be imported and analyzed using the second script ("002_analysis_script.R").
